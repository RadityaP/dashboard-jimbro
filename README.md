# Hi, this is your Jimbro!

Need to find a gym partner that always reminds you of your progresses and goals? Also motivates you to go to gym? If you have one, it's fine. If you don't have any? I think you can go to gym with me :)

Jimbro is a personal gym tracker and reminder, with a lot of features (that will be developed), which is:

1. Authentication
2. Gym Program Recommendation
3. Graph
4. Track
5. Reminder
6. And another additional features

You can also share your program and progresses with others!
